<h4>Infinite adventure around
every corner</h4>

<p>A premium urban explorer, capable of going from city block, to
off-road trail (and back) in a heartbeat. The X-ADV turns every
single ride into a unique experience. A tubular steel
diamond-style frame, combined with the steering geometry and
long travel suspension provides light and agile handling. The
redesigned seat makes ground reach easier and new bodywork
heightens a rugged style that the X-ADV has made its own.</p>

<h4>Designed to support you</h4>
<p>Throttle By Wire (TBW) control and four default riding modes
optimise performance to suit conditions and terrain. And the
X-ADV is flexible – you have the option to fully customise
engine output and character, as well as the Dual Clutch
Transmission (DCT) shifting schedule, Honda Selectable
Torque Control (HSTC) and ABS level. In all default road riding
modes, the ABS level is high; with GRAVEL mode selected
ABS level is low, for efficient and consistent braking on loose
surfaces. The rear indicators feature Emergency Stop Signal
(ESS), which flashes the rear hazards under extreme braking.</p>

<h4>No matter the terrain</h4>
<p>Long-travel, 41mm cartridge-style Up Side Down (USD) front
forks adjust for spring preload and rebound damping. They
provide superb bump absorption on broken tarmac or rutted
trails, and everything in between. The lightweight aluminium
swingarm operates a single-tube, split-pressure monoshock,
adjustable for spring preload to maintain optimum steering
ability when loaded. The 17-inch front wheel and 15-inch rear
use stainless steel rust-resistant spokes and contribute to the
X-ADV’s capacity to soak up rough terrain.</p>

<h4>Stay connected</h4>
<p>The full-colour TFT screen offers intuitive control. You can also
now link to many smartphone functions, such as navigation,
calls, messages and music, via the new Honda Smartphone
Voice Control system (available with Android™ and iOS™
devices). So, wherever you end up, you’re never out of touch.
You can manage riding modes quickly and easily, as well as
customise the information displayed to suit your preference.</p>
