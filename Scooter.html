<p>A scooter (motor scooter) is a motorcycle with an underbone or step-through frame, a seat, and a
platform for the rider's feet, emphasizing comfort and fuel economy. Elements of scooter design
were present in some of the earliest motorcycles, and motor scooters have been made since at least
1914.
The global popularity of motor scooters dates from the post-World War II introductions of the Vespa
and Lambretta models in Italy. These scooters were intended to provide economical personal
transportation (engines from 50 to 150 cc or 3.1 to 9.2 cu in). The original layout is still widely used
in this application. Maxi-scooters, with larger engines from 200 to 850 cc (12 to 52 cu in) have been
developed for Western markets.
Scooters are popular for personal transportation partly due to being more affordable, easier to
operate, and more convenient to park and store than a car. Licensing requirements for scooters are
easier and cheaper than for cars in most parts of the world, and insurance is usually cheaper. The
term motor scooter is sometimes used to avoid confusion with kick scooter, but can then be
confused with motorized scooter or e-scooter, a kick-scooter with an electric motor.

<h4>Description<h4>

<p>The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary defines a motor scooter as a motorcycle similar to a kick
scooter with a seat, a floorboard, and small or low wheels. The US Department of Transportation
defines a scooter as a motorcycle that has a platform for the operator's feet or has integrated
footrests and has a step-through architecture.
The classic scooter design features a step-through frame and a flat floorboard for the rider's feet.
This design is possible because most scooter engines and drive systems are attached to the rear
axle or under the seat. Unlike a conventional motorcycle, in which the engine is mounted on the
frame, most modern scooters allow the engine to swing with the rear wheel, while most vintage
scooters and some newer retro models have an axle-mounted engine. Modern scooters starting
from the late-1980s generally use a continuously variable transmission (CVT), while older ones use
a manual transmission with the gearshift and clutch control built into the left handlebar.
Scooters usually feature bodywork, including a front leg shield and body that conceals all or most of
the mechanicals. There is often some integral storage space, either under the seat, built into the
front leg shield, or both. Scooters have varying engine displacements and configurations ranging
from 50 cc (3.1 cu in) single-cylinder to 850 cc (52 cu in) twin-cylinder models.
Traditionally, scooter wheels are smaller than conventional motorcycle wheels and are made of
pressed steel or cast aluminum alloy, bolt on easily, and often are interchangeable between front and
rear. Some scooters carry a spare wheel. Many recent scooters use conventional front forks with the
front axle fastened at both ends.</p>

<h4>Emissions</h4>

<p>The emissions of mopeds and scooters have been the subject of multiple studies. Studies have
found that two-stroke 50 cc mopeds, with and without catalytic converters, emit ten to thirty times
more hydrocarbons and particulate emissions than the outdated Euro 3 automobile standards. In the
same study, four-stroke mopeds, with and without catalytic converters, emitted three to eight times
more hydrocarbons and particulate emissions than the Euro 3 automobile standards. Approximate
parity with automobiles was achieved with NOx emissions in these studies. Emissions performance
was tested on a g/km basis and was unaffected by fuel economy. In 2011 the United States
Environmental Protection Agency allowed motorcycles, scooters, and mopeds with engine
displacements less than 280 cc to emit ten times the NOx and six times the CO than the median Tier
II bin 5 automobile regulations.[ An additional air quality challenge can also arise from the use of
moped and scooter transportation over automobiles, as a higher density of two-wheeled vehicles
can be supported by existing transportation infrastructure.
In Genoa, 2-stroke engine scooters made before 1999 are banned since 2019. In some cities, such
as Shanghai, petrol scooters/mopeds are banned and only LPG or electric scooters are allowed to
be used in the city due to air pollution.</p>

<h4>Predecessors</h4>

<p>Scooter-like traits began to develop in motorcycle designs around the 1900s. In 1894, Hildebrand &
Wolfmüller in Munich, Germany produced the first motorcycle that was available for purchase. Their
motorcycle had a step-through frame, with its fuel tank mounted on the down tube, its parallel
two-cylinder engine mounted low on the frame, and its cylinders mounted in line with the frame. It
was water-cooled and had a radiator built into the top of the rear fender. It became the first
mass-produced and publicly sold powered two-wheel vehicle, and among the first powered mainly
by its engine rather than foot pedals. Maximum speed was 40 km/h (25 mph). The rear wheel was
driven directly by rods from the pistons in a manner similar to the drive wheels of steam locomotives.
Only a few hundred such bikes were built, and the high price and technical difficulties made the
venture a financial failure for both Wolfmüller and his financial backer, Hildebrand.[15]
In France, the Auto-Fauteuil was introduced in 1902. This was basically a step-through motorcycle
with an armchair instead of a traditional saddle. Production continued until 1922.</p>

<h4>Developments</h4>

<p>Trends around the world have seen new developments of the classic scooter, some with larger
engines and tires. High-end scooter models now include comprehensive technological features,
including cast aluminium frames, engines with integral counterbalancing, and cross-linked brake
systems. Some of these scooters have comfort features such as an alarm, start button, radio,
windshield, heated hand grips and full instrumentation (including clock or outside temperature
gauge).</p>
